Description:
You see 2 platforms painted with different colors, red and blue, you can control red one. There is a ball, that moving on the screen. There are 2 circle segments: red and blue too -- be carefull with them, because if a ball, then it has color different than your platform, falls on your segment, you will lose a point!

You can control your platform with mouse clicking or arrow keys.
